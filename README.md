# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The reason I created this study guide is for me to get my foot in the door of what it is like to be a web developer. I used basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple study guide that I, or anyone else trying to learn the basics of web development can easily go to. This project taught me how to structure a webpage through HTML, how to add style with CSS, and functionality with JavaScript. I've listed my own notes on the page. I hope it could possibly help any aspiring web developer with the beginning of their journey.

## Usage

I've devided each section into their respective topics. HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Feel free to start at any point. If you have trouble choosing  where to start, right click the page and choose 'Inspect' and open the console tab. There you can find the JavaScript code that is running and it will give you a random topic to study!
